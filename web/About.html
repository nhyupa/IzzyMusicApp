                                    <p>The Violin is among the most expressive of instruments and has inspired a treasury of great music, makers and
                                        performers. Learning to play the Violin is a skill that is difficult to acquire and an uphill task. However, being able to play
                                        well and produce beautiful tones from it is a very rewarding experience. <br><br>
                                        Over the years of teaching, performing and studying the Violin, I have encountered many students who struggle to learn
                                        the basics of pitching notes accurately and teachers who continue to use visual aids on fingerboards even many years after
                                        the introduction of the instrument. Students have given up learning because of the frustration of not being able to grasp
                                        pitching concepts. So I thought: “How can I make a difficult instrument easier to learn?” It is with this intent that the
                                        idea of <strong>Violin Scales & Arpeggios with fingering: Building a Strong Foundation </strong> was conceived. <br><br>
                                        Fingering suggestions are written on every scale and arpeggio. Considerations for the fingerings are heavily based on
                                        memorability and logical progression, especially for the higher grades where any scale or arpeggio(from memory) are
                                        called on from the vast pool during an exam. <br><br>
                                        Teacher’s notes are written in consideration for the particular grade, including common mistakes and what to watch out
                                        for when executing the scale or arpeggio. <br><br>

                                        <li>Do not rush through the notes with each scale or arpeggio but first practice them slowly to ensure they are all in tune.</li>
                                        <li>Execute the notes evenly, do not rush parts of it in either the front, middle or the end.</li>
                                        <li>Familiarise with the sound of the intervals. (E.g. Major: Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do)</li>
